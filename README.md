# PyTile

PyTile​​ is a high-performance, tile-based programming language and framework designed specifically for GPU and NPU acceleration, offering Python developers an intuitive way to harness parallel computing power without compromising productivity. Inspired by NVIDIA's ​​CuTile​​ model, PyTile reimagines array-centric computation by abstracting low-level hardware complexities into ​​tiles​​—logical data blocks that serve as the fundamental unit of execution.

Key Features:

​​Tile-Centric Abstraction​​:

PyTile treats multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., vectors, matrices, or tensors) as tiles, allowing developers to express computations at a higher level of granularity. The compiler automatically optimizes tile partitioning, memory allocation, and thread mapping to GPU/NPU hardware.

Example:

python
# Define a tile-based matrix multiplication

@pytile.kernel
def matmul(TensorA, TensorB, TensorC, m_t, n_t, k_t):
    pA = TensorA.Partition([(0, m_t), (1, k_t)]).Partition([(0, pt.pid[0])])
    pB = TensorB.Partition([(0, m_t), (1, k_t)]).Partition([(0, pt.pid[1])])
    pC = TensorC.Partition([(0, m_t), (1, k_t)]).Partition([(0, pt.pid[0]), (1, pt.pid[1])])
    for i_index in range(len(pA[block_id][0]):
        for j_index in range(len(pB[block_id][0])):
            for k_index in range(pA[block_id][1]):
                task_load_A = pt.load(rA, pA[pt.pid[0]][i_index][k_index])
                task_load_B = pt.load(rB, pB[pt.pid[1]][j_index][k_index])
                task_gemm = pt.gemm(rA, rB, rC)
                if k_index == 0:
                    task_copy = pt.copy(rC, rD)
                else:
                    task_add = pt.add(rC, rD, rD)
            task_store = pt.store(rD, pC[pt.pid[0], pt.pid[1]][i_index][j_index])



​​Seamless Python Integration​​:

PyTile provides Pythonic APIs that mirror NumPy and PyTorch semantics. Developers can transition CPU-bound code to GPU/NPU with minimal changes—often just modifying imports.

Example: Replace import numpy as np with import pytile.numpy as np for GPU acceleration.

​​Cross-Platform Performance​​:

PyTile's compiler backend supports multiple architectures (NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and NPUs like Huawei Ascend) through adaptive code generation. It integrates with ​​Triton​​-like JIT compilation for near-metal efficiency.

​​Advanced Tooling​​:

​​Auto-Tiling​​: Dynamically adjusts tile sizes based on hardware specs (e.g., H100 Tensor Cores).
​​Unified Memory​​: Simplifies data movement between host and device with zero-copy abstractions.
​​Profiling Suite​​: Built-in performance analyzers visualize tile utilization and memory bottlenecks.

​​Ecosystem Synergy​​:
PyTile interoperates with popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and accelerates domain-specific workloads, such as LLM inference, scientific simulations, and real-time image processing
