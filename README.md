# PyTile

PyTile​​ is a high-performance, tile-based programming language and framework designed specifically for GPU and NPU acceleration, offering Python developers an intuitive way to harness parallel computing power without compromising productivity. Inspired by NVIDIA's ​​CuTile​​ model, PyTile reimagines array-centric computation by abstracting low-level hardware complexities into ​​tiles​​—logical data blocks that serve as the fundamental unit of execution.

Key Features:

​​Tile-Centric Abstraction​​:

PyTile treats multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., vectors, matrices, or tensors) as tiles, allowing developers to express computations at a higher level of granularity. The compiler automatically optimizes tile partitioning, memory allocation, and thread mapping to GPU/NPU hardware.

Example:

python
# Define a tile-based matrix multiplication  
@pytile.kernel  
def matmul(A: Tile[float32], B: Tile[float32], C: Tile[float32]):  
    i, j = pytile.indices(2)  
    C[i, j] = sum(A[i, k] * B[k, j] for k in range(A.shape[1]))  
    
​​Seamless Python Integration​​:

PyTile provides Pythonic APIs that mirror NumPy and PyTorch semantics. Developers can transition CPU-bound code to GPU/NPU with minimal changes—often just modifying imports.

Example: Replace import numpy as np with import pytile.numpy as np for GPU acceleration.

​​Cross-Platform Performance​​:

PyTile's compiler backend supports multiple architectures (NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and NPUs like Huawei Ascend) through adaptive code generation. It integrates with ​​Triton​​-like JIT compilation for near-metal efficiency.

​​Advanced Tooling​​:

​​Auto-Tiling​​: Dynamically adjusts tile sizes based on hardware specs (e.g., H100 Tensor Cores).
​​Unified Memory​​: Simplifies data movement between host and device with zero-copy abstractions.
​​Profiling Suite​​: Built-in performance analyzers visualize tile utilization and memory bottlenecks.

​​Ecosystem Synergy​​:
PyTile interoperates with popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and accelerates domain-specific workloads, such as LLM inference, scientific simulations, and real-time image processing
